üéÖ Santa.finance is the much needed DeFi fairytale üßö

Yield Farming or liquidity mining revolutionized the token distribution process with no pre-mine, no venture capital, and no founder fees. The goal for yield farming is to have a better distribution of tokens for governance but it has turned out to be quite the opposite.

#Introducing Yield Farming 2.0

Santa.finance introduces a new yield farming mechanism that ensures a very diverse participation in the governance community. $SNTA is mined by three key stakeholders of the santa.finance community.

Projects using only liquidity mining end up with crypto whales acting as lenders, borrowers and governance stakeholders. Santa.finance incentivises user behaviour to encourage participation of everyone. 

Without reinventing the wheel, santa.finance takes important learnings from user behaviour in three widely adopted consensus mechanisms.

Based on the above learnings, stakeholders are incentivised for their work, resources and credibility in santa.finance. 10,000 $SNTA are allocated for users (borrowers), 10,000 $SNTA for liquidity providers (lenders), and 10,000 $SNTA for adoption drivers (Influencers)

Platform users (Borrowers) don‚Äôt have resources (capital) at disposal, but they do possess the ultimate resource - TIME. Users can invest their time to redeem sTIME tokens. Santa.finance gives true meaning to the concept of ‚ÄòTIME IS MONEY‚Äô

Liquidity providers can provide liquidity to the sPOOL by staking USDT, USDC, DAI, or TUSD and redeem sSTAKE tokens with liquidity mining.

Adoption is extremely important for a DAO to function, adoption drivers contribute by spreading awareness on Twitter and redeem sCRED tokens for their effort.

After the genesis mining period ends, $SNTA tokens can be redeemed against sTIME, sSTAKE, and sCRED tokens based on the following formula
